Hello ! 

I am a junior student at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea.

I'm majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, and Statistics.

My interests are Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Data Mining.

<!--Especially, I'm interested in Information Retrieval which can fully interpret the intention of query and retrieve appropriate documents.-->
