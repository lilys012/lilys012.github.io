Hello ! 

I am majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, and Statistics at Seoul National University.

My interests are Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Data Mining.

Especially, I'm interested in Information Retrieval and Open-domain Question Answering which can fully interpret the intention of query and retrieve appropriate documents or answer.
